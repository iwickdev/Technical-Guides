> How to use the TCPView application by Microsoft in Sysinternals to view network connections

## What is it?
TCPView is a network application by Microsoft in the Sysinternals toolkit that can allow you to see what incoming and outgoing connections
applications on your machine are making. This can be useful to identify malicious applications or for identifying what places applications
are going to.

## How do I use it?
TCPView like many other Sysinternals tools are simple in concept but are very information heavy so don't feel overwhelmed.
When you open the application you will be given a screen that contains a list of connections applications are making. The format
will be the following;
- Process Name
    - The executable that is making the connection
- Process ID
    - The PID of the application
- Protocol
    - The network protocol the connection is using (for example TCP or UDP)
- State
    - The state the connection is in (for example Listening, Time Wait, or Established)
- Local Address
    - The local address of where the connection is created from (for example 192.168.1.4 a local address)
- Local Port
    - The local port the connection is created from
- Remote Address
    - The external address the connection is going to (for example 142.250.190.78 (google.com))
- Remote Port
    - The external port the connection is going to
- Create Time
    - The time the connection was created
- Module Name
    - The full name of the application (usually the name as process name but can differ)
- Sent Packets / Sent Bytes / Recv Packets / Recv Bytes
    - The amount of data both sent and received in both packet count then the actual total size in bytes

When looking at this data you want to be looking for applications you don't know you have installed connected to the internet or to strange locations.
For example if you saw an application named "sglebhuri.exe" and its connected to "ransomware.c2c.edu" something is probably off (this is a sarcastic example but you get the point),
if you do find something strange you can find the location of the executable by right clicking on the entry and selecting "Process Properties". Then see the "Path" item.
If the path of the executable does not give away anything about what it is, you can upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to get a scan of it.
